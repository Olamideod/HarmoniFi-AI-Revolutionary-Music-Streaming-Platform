## Challenge Statement

* **Problem to Solve:** Enhance the music streaming experience by offering users a Spotify clone equipped with an intelligent music recommendation system.
* **What it Will Not Solve:** HarmoniFi will not address music licensing issues. It assumes the availability of content similar to Spotify.
* **Target Audience:** Music enthusiasts who seek a user-friendly platform with personalized music recommendations.
* **Global Reach:** The project is targeted towards a global user base, with no specific locale dependence.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

* **Technical Risks:**
  * Potential API restrictions: We will maintain regular communication with Spotify regarding API updates.
  * Algorithm complexity: Prototyping different algorithms will help us determine the most efficient and scalable approach.
* **Non-Technical Risks:**
  * User adoption: We will incorporate user feedback loops to continuously improve the platform and attract users.
  * Competition: We will develop well-defined marketing strategies to stand out from existing solutions.

## Infrastructure

* **Version Control:** We will utilize Git for version control, employing branches for feature development and merging after thorough code reviews.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Automated deployment on Zeet, including deployment of the PostgreSQL database. Staging environments will be used for thorough testing before pushing updates to production.
* **Data Population:** Initial data will be populated from public music datasets. User-generated data will also contribute to enriching the system over time.
* **Testing:** Unit testing will cover backend logic, while Selenium will be used for frontend testing. Additionally, continuous integration will ensure automated testing throughout the development process.

## Existing Solutions and Differentiation

* **Spotify:** Similarities include music streaming and playlist functionality. However, HarmoniFi differentiates itself with its intelligent music recommendation system.
* **Apple Music and Deezer:** Similarities include music streaming capabilities. Differentiation factors lie in user interface/user experience design and the implementation of unique recommendation algorithms.

## Reimplementation Decision:

While existing solutions offer music streaming services, HarmoniFi aims to stand out by providing an intelligent recommendation system. It combines the strengths of popular platforms with a personalized user experience.
